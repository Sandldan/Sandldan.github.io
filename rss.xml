                    <description>&lt;p&gt;During my late teenage years I started thinking about getting a tattoo, eventually the thought turned into a fact, a fact without need to be reflected on any longer, it&#39;s been sitting there as a fact all this time until I now at 31 have booked my first appointment. This provoked the former undisputable fact, which decided to morph back into a thought that I can work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&#39;m not unfamiliar to this happening, who&#39;s able to keep any doubt out when confronted with a permanent decision? I still feel sure of getting the tattoo, but it&#39;s a perfect opportunity to dig deeper to where the doubts or uncertainty actually are coming from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Where did the idea come from?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had the idea for such a long time It&#39;s hard to recall where it started, when reflecting I might be able to come up with a few resons (are they the original ones or just my current interpretations of the past?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i title=&#34;YOLO&#34;&gt;While I live I want to finish a reasonably long todo list&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I got influenced by people and media around me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it&#39;s almost impossible to separate out the external influence, as it has been a passive thought for such a long time it makes it harder to separate my original reasoning from other sources. And even if I could, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s any more value in having the original idea come just from myself. What matters is what I want now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Regret&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking back to the tattoo ideas I had 10 years ago, I would probably not get the same tattoos today, will the same be true 10 years in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s tricky... I think the only old ideas that I&#39;d dislike today are anything based on any kind of culture or trend, and my emotion towards it might change a lot after wearing the tattoo for many years as well. I think I early came to the conclusion to get a tattoo from an artist I like and that simply looks good for what it is, trying not to instill too much meaning into it.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is it me?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seemingly obvious question, which feels a bit more complex, am I just copying trends? Influenced by people around me? How will this reflect off of me? I think I enjoy being a blank slate, having a style and presence that can fit in everywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growing up I quickly removed styles, habits and accents, anything that could be used to read into my interests or background. I enjoyed surprising people who had no idea I was this geeky, that I came from this country, that I&#39;ve done these things. I had a goal of experiencing as much as possible and to do this I felt I had to be able to partially fit in as many contexts as possible, in a way you lose out a bit here, you go broader but not deeper in areas and relations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is where most of my sudden unease is coming from? By getting a permanent tattoo I&#39;m projecting parts of myself in a very visible way. The style, motive and placement of the tattoo will expose something about me that I can&#39;t take back, I can&#39;t control how others perceive it. It&#39;s a bit ironic, by making a part of myself more solid and visible, I feel I might in exchange lose a part of myself, I&#39;m not as much of a blank slate surprise anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As planned I went to get a tattoo with no hesitations left in my mind, writing these thoughts down definitely helped to untangle myself while achieving a bit deeper insights into my motivations. Maybe it&#39;ll help me in putting part of myself out there without being afraid of how it might be perceived by others, or maybe, just maybe - &lt;i&gt;it&#39;s just a tattoo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good and short introduction for anyone interested in the subject of big data and its potential negative side effects, I think the core message can be summarized in this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that&#39;s something only humans can provide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science is nothing new, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think many people are familiar with how its being applied, chances are that you have already been indirectly affected by it, positively or negatively. So how is it being used then? When people try to answer a seemingly simply question with a system, questions like which school is the best? Can I trust this person enough to give a loan? Will this person end up in jail again? Through computers and enough data available we believe we can answer these questions easily, though in reality many of these systems end up as a Weapon of Math Destruction (WMD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time people&amp;rsquo;s own biases and racisms are unintentionally encoded into these systems, for example race might not be an explicit variable but zip codes can make for a near identical substitute. In the end these systems end up working great for many people and can go horribly wrong for others, do you live in a bad neighbourhood but have no criminal record? Chances are you&amp;rsquo;ll be judged more harshly than someone from a different background. In the race for improved school ratings tuition fees is not a variable which has contributed to the astronomical increase in fees for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts with defining what a WMD is and continues by going through various examples in great detail. it kind of stops a bit abruptly after this without much further elaboration. Most of the examples throughout the book are very US-centric, where regulation is usually more reactive rather than pre-emptive, compared to Europe, as far as I know these systems are not as widely adopted or even usable in Europe. I&amp;rsquo;d be very interested to know more of such systems being used here as it&amp;rsquo;s not something that&amp;rsquo;s generally widely reported on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, great short read that can open up your eyes to something that feels obvious in retrospect, which is one of the better results after finishing a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this book would&amp;rsquo;ve been slightly better for my past self to have read, with the potential issue of my past self not being fully reciprocal to the content nor interested enough to pick up the book in the first place. I&amp;rsquo;d blame myself for being too enthusiastic about the tech industry and its seemingly endless possibilities as well as being too focused on my own career path. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget to stop and reflect on your own privileges and empathising with others situation&amp;rsquo;s during your own struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a great read for anyone working in tech or anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interacting with parts of the tech industry (which is most people these days). The book succinctly breaks down the broken feedback loops of biases, ethical oversights and sexisms littered throughout the tech industry specifically. It&amp;rsquo;s not something most of us feel we perpetuate, we&amp;rsquo;re just doing our best to solve interesting problems right? But the problems runs deeper than any single individual, the culture that has been set as precedence by successful companies is non welcoming to outsiders resulting in a lack of diversity which in turn shows itself in how the technology around us is meant to be interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a short read with a lot of anecdotal stories, lacking a bit in deeper insights and advice. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following the tech industry for a longer time you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely been able to pick up most pieces presented in the book, but you might not pieced everything together in feedback the broad perspective given in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;During quarantine I&#39;ve managed to get up with the sun a few early weekend mornings. Strolling around the city canals before people have reclaimed the streets. The slowly dissipating morning fog of the city is home to a surprisingly active wildlife, birds, fish and cats is the main life grabbing your attention. When back home it feels like I&#39;ve come back from a different world, like a long holiday, this feeling usually sticks with you for the full day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to continue this even after quarantine, with or without a camera. Here&#39;s some of the photos I&#39;ve taken during a few Utrecht mornings&lt;/p&gt;
